## Purpose behind the development of the exhibit

The real purpose behind the model is to
or seriously injured due to over speeding. As per statistics most of the
prevent road users from being killed
accidents are caused by over speeding of 4 wheelers which costs life of
pedestrians (especially youth of India). The basic strategy of a Safe System
approach is to ensure that in the event of a crash, the impact energies
remain below the threshold likely to produce either death or serious injury.
According to the WHO, more than 1 million people are killed on the world's
roads each year.
Near Schools and Hospitals people in hurry tend to forget that they should
slow down their vehicles to maintain safety. The critical accident near our

school during recess due to over speeding was an eye opener for us. The 4
wheeler hit the motorcyclist while trying to overtake a rickshaw puller at
high speed.

If over speeding is reduced then things will become better.

- Save lives
- Save Fuel
- Less stress
- Simplify your life

## The Scientific principle involved

The Scientific principle involved in the exhibit is about kinematics and dynamics of rigid body which includes calculations based on motion. It includes calculation of parameters like speed, distance, acceleration. The project is about notch speed at roads near schools and hospitals and also includes programming of microcontrollers to restrict over speeding.

## How mathematics is helping in reducing death toll

The coding of sensors were all about mathematics. Moreover the statistics of death toll helped us to make a model that can reduce accidents due to over speeding.

# 2.DESCRIPTION

## Material used
- Arduino Microcontroller – for controlling and automating the behaviour of the vehicle and the sensors mounted on it.
- Infrared Emitter – Set up on the Speed breakers to emit IR light towards the vehicle.
- Infrared Receiver – Mounted on the vehicle to sense the presence of the emitted IR light.
- LCD Display – To display the current speed of the vehicle

## Working of the model

The primary goal of our model is to automatically slow down vehicles approaching or passing by zones/roads with assigned speed limits, such as: School buildings, hospitals, construction sites, commonly crowded areas etc.
To achieve this, the model consists of several speed breakers embedded with Infrared Emitters. These emitters continuously flash IR rays which can later be sensed by an IR sensor/receiver mounted on the underside of the vehicle.
These infrared rays extend from the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum at 700 nanometres (nm) to 1 millimetre (mm). This range
of wavelengths corresponds to a frequency range of approximately 430 THz down to 300 GHz.
The speed breaker prompts the driver to slow down the vehicle and this facilitates the easy recognition/sensing of the IR rays by the sensor mounted on the vehicle.
Once the signal is received, the speed of the vehicle is gradually decreased and is limited to the set speed limit through the ECU (that is pre-installed in almost every vehicle.) The automobile now can only accelerate to a certain set speed until it reaches the end of the specified area/road.
When the vehicle encounters the second speed breaker at the end of the road, the same sensing process repeats and prompts the ECU to dismiss the speed limit and the automobile sets back to its normal functioning.
The intensity of IR light can be easily adjusted to a standard set to specify different speed limits at different roads.

## Applications

This simple project can be of great help in reducing traffic accidents and jams caused by over-speeding and other such traffic violations.
It can be especially useful in-front of School buildings, hospitals, constructions sites etc.
This technology can be easily integrated with the pre-existing infrastructure of modern cities and can be developed to be highly feasible.
The main components i.e. the IR emitters and receivers are easily available and cheap while also being energy efficient and low power consuming (they can even be powered by solar cells on an open road.)
Almost all modern commercial vehicles have some type of an ECU (Electronic Control Unit) which, to some extent already limits the speeds of the automobile. These can be easily re-programed to work with the IR sensors and change the speed limit accordingly.

## Conclusion

Till now, not lot of work has been carried out in this area. Numerous articles were found related to the present road conditions and urgent need of safety measures. Various studies are being carried out but the documentation is not yet done. Also the implementation of various proposed methods is not feasible.
